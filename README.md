This repository contains a step-by-step Machine Learning project on the Indian diabetes dataset. The goal is to build predictive models to classify whether a person has diabetes or not, based on relevant clinical features.

The project is organized into Jupyter notebooks that walk through data import, exploratory analysis, model building (linear models, Bayesian SVM, etc.), and visualization.
